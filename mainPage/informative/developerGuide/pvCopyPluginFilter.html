<h2>Plugin Filters for pvCopy</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<h4>epics base</h4>
<p>Starting with 3.15 epics-base provides plugin filters,
which allows a channel Access client to attach filters when accessing
a DBRecord.
</p>
<p>
The initial implementation implements the following filters:
<b>timeStamp</b>, <b>deadband</b>, <b>array</b> and <b>synchronize</b>. 
</p>
<p>
Other than <b>synchronize</b> the other filters are also described below.
</p>
<h4>javaIOC</h4>
<p>The <b>javaIOC</b> was a Java only project started in 2006.
It bacame the basis for what is now pvData, pvAccess, pvDatabase,etc.
It allowed a client to specify options similar to plugin filters but
the implementation relied on code implemented in the IOC portion of javaIOC,
via what was called record and field support.
</p>
<p>
In about 2010 a decision was made to implement major portions of the javaIOC
in both Java and C++.
The record and field support was abandoned when the IOC portion of javaIOC was replaced
by pvDatabaseJava, pvDatabaseCPP, and pvaSrv.
</p>
<p>The <b>pvData</b> part of the <b>javaIOC</b> already had the
copy support that <b>pvDataJava</b> and <b>pvDataCPP</b> both implement.
Thus if the copy facility implements plugin filter support
then all providers that use the copy facility will automatically have plugin
filter support.
</p>
<p>
This is what is described below.
</p>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<dl>
    <dt>Primary Objective</dt>
       <dd>The primary objective is to allow a client to optionally attach
       filters to any field of the data structure it is accessing via the data provider.
       </dd>
    <dt>Mechanism</dt>
       <dd>
          Plugin Filter Support via the copy facility of <b>pvData</b>.
       </dd>
</dl>
<p>The following filters are provided by pvData itself and the plugin
automatically registered when an instance of <b>pvCopy</b> is created.
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>array</dt>
       <dd>
          Specifies a subset of a scalar array field.
       </dd>
    <dt>deadband</dt>
       <dd>
         Specifies a deadband for monitors for a numeric scalar field.
       </dd>
    <dt>timestamp</dt>
       <dd>
        Allows the client to receive the current time rather than the time from the data.
       </dd>
    <dt>ignore</dt>
       <dd>
        For monitors the field does not result in a monitor event.
       </dd>
</dl>
<p>Additional plugins can also implemented.</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>As described in a previous section, both record and field options can be specified.
This section describes field options.
</p>
<p>Some examples are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
       Get a subset of an array. In this example elements 5 through 10.
<pre>
pvget -r "field(value[array=5:10])" someScalarArray
</pre>
     </li>
     <li>
      Monitor a record that has a numeric scalar value field<br />
      But only when value changes by at least 1.0 should a monitor occur.
      Changes in the timeStamp field are ignored if no other fields being monitored
      change value.
<pre>
pvget -m -r "field(value[deadband=abs:1.0],timeStamp[ignore=true]" someNumericScalar 
</pre>
      </li>
</ul>
<h3>Field Plugin Filters</h3>
<p><b>pvCopy</b>, which was described above, implements plugin filters that can optionally
be attached to fields accessed via pvCopy.
Thus, if a  channel provider uses pvCopy, it automatically has plugin filter support.
</p>
<p>
<b>pvCopy</b> itself provides the following plugins: <b>array</b>, <b>deadband</b>,
<b>timestamp</b>, and <b>ignore</b>.
Other plugins can also be implemented and registered.
</p>
<p>
The following interfaces are used for implementing plugin filters:
<b>PVPlugin</b>, <b>PVFilter</b>, and <b>PVPluginRegistry</b>.
</p>
<h4>PVPlugin</h4>
<p>
Method <b>create</b> is called when an instance of pvCopy is created by a channel provider.
</p>
<pre>
interface PVPlugin {
    PVFilter create(String requestValue,PVCopy pvCopy,PVField master);
}
</pre>
where
<dl>
   <dt>requestValue</dt>
   <dd>
    The value part of a name=value request option.
   </dd>
   <dt>pvCopy</dt>
   <dd>
    The PVCopy to which the PVFilter will be attached.
   </dd>
   <dt>master</dt>
   <dd>
   The field in the master PVStructure to which the PVFilter will be attached.
   </dd>
</dl>
<p>
Returns the PVFilter. A null is returned if master or requestValue is not appropriate for the plugin.
</p>
<h4>PVFilter</h4>
<p>
The method <b>filter</b> is called whenever pvCopy is used to access a field of the client
PVStructure.
</p>
<pre>
interface PVFilter {
    boolean filter(PVField copy,BitSet bitSet,boolean toCopy);
    String getName();
}
</pre>
where
<dl>
   <dt>copy</dt>
   <dd>
    The data for copy.
   </dd>
   <dt>bitSet</dt>
   <dd>
    The BitSet for copy.
   </dd>
   <dt>toCopy</dt>
   <dd>
   (true,false) means copy (from master to copy,from copy to master)
   </dd>
</dl>
<p>
Returns (true,false) if filter modified destination.
</p>
<h4>PVPluginRegistry</h4>
<pre>
class PVPluginRegistry {
    static void registerPlugin(String name,PVPlugin pvPlugin);
    static PVPlugin find(String name);
}
</pre>
The arguments are:
<dl>
   <dt>name</dt>
   <dd>
    The name part of a name=value request option.
   </dd>
   <dt>pvPlugin</dt>
   <dd>
    The plugin implementation.
   </dd>
</dl>
<p>The return value for <b>find</b> is the plugin implementation or null if no plugin
with that name has been registered.
</p>
<h3>Array Plugin</h3>
<p>
This  filter is used to retrieve parts of an array (subarrays and strided subarrays).
It is modeled after the array Filter that is provided with epics base starting with
the 3.15 releases.
</p>
<p>
This filter works for both get and put.
It works for any scalarArray field.
It has not been tested for structureArray or unionArray fields.
</p>
<p>The syntax is one of the following:</p>
<pre>
[array=start]
[array=start:end]
[array=start:increment:end]
</pre>
<p>
<b>start</b> and <b>end</b> both specify an index.
<b>increment</b> must be a positive integer.
</p>
<p>
<b>start</b> and <b>end</b> can be a positive or negative integer.
If negative it is relative to the end of the array with -1 meaning the last element.
</p>
<p>Suppose that the master array is:</p>
<pre>
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
</pre>
<p>Then the get request</p>
<pre>
[array=0:4]
</pre>
gets
<pre>
1,2,3,4,5
</pre>
The request:
<pre>
[array=-3:-1]
</pre>
gets
<pre>
8,9,10
</pre>
The request:
<pre>
[array=2:5]
</pre>
gets
<pre>
3,4,5,6
</pre>
The request:
<pre>
[array=0:2:-1]
</pre>
gets
<pre>
0,2,4,6,8,10
</pre>
<h3>Deadband Plugin</h3>
<p>
This filter is used to limit the changes to a numeric scalar field that are reported to a client. 
It is modeled after the deadband Filter that is provided with epics base starting with
the 3.15 releases.
</p>
<p>
This filter only works for numeric scalar fields and only for toCopy.
</p>
<p>The syntax is one of the following:</p>
<pre>
[deadband=abs:value]
[deadband=rel:value]
</pre>
where
<dl>
   <dt>abs</dt>
    <dd>The value must change by at least this amount since the last value the client received.</dd>
   <dt>rel</dt>
     <dd>
       The percentage amount the value must change since the last value the client received. 
     </dd>
</dl>
<h3>TimeStamp Plugin</h3>
<p>
This filter is used for accessing a timeStamp field. 
It is modeled after the timeStamp Filter that is provided with epics base starting with
the 3.15 releases.
</p>
<p>
This filter only works for a timeStamp field.
</p>
<p>The syntax is one of the following:</p>
<pre>
[timestamp=current]
[timestamp=copy]
</pre>
where
<dl>
  <dt>current</dt>
     <dd>
      Only works for toCopy=true.
      Instead of taking the timestamp from master the timeStamp for the client is set to
      the current time.
     </dd>
   <dt>copy</dt>
     <dd>
      Only works for toCopy=false.
      The timestamp in master is set equal to the timeStamp from the client.
     </dd>
</dl>
<h3>Ignore Plugin</h3>
<p>This is not an actual plugin but is handled by pvCopy itself.
It is used to suppress sending data to a client unless other fields have changed.
</p>
<p>The syntax is:</p>
<pre>
[ignore=true]
</pre>
One of the examples shown at the beginning of this section shows how it can be used.
