<!-- Statement about why this version exists -->

<p>This is the January 2016 version of the EPICS V4 Core Module Development and
Release Guide. Previous document versions were specific to a particular release
of the software, but this version is now meant to be generic.</p>

<!-- Please always include this statement of terms, unless it's really silly -->
<p>The terms MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, REQUIRED, and MAY when
highlighted (through style sheets, and in uppercase in the source) are used in
accordance with <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC 2119</a> [<a
href="refs.html#ref-RFC2119">RFC2119</a>]. The term NOT REQUIRED (not defined
in RFC 2119) indicates exemption.</p>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document defines the policies that apply to all core EPICS V4 software
modules produced by the EPICS V4 Working Group, and the procedures that are to
be followed when creating official releases of those modules.</p>

<h3>Applicability</h3>

<p>The policies described here have been developed for and agreed by the EPICS
V4 Working Group, and apply to all core software modules developed for and
formally published by the group.</p>

<p>The procedures documented here SHOULD be followed anyone involved in making
officially numbered releases of the EPICS V4 software modules.</p>


<h2>Release Numbering</h2>

<p>The EPICS V4 C++ and Java packages are released separately but share a common
package version number, indicating that the available functionality for the two
implementations should be similar. Each package is made up from a collection of
individual modules which are developed and released in coordination with the V4
packaging process. However each module has its own independent module version
number which is NOT REQUIRED to be related to the version number of the package
it is published in.</p>

<p>When a package release is being developed, the version numbers of the modules
that will make up that package are collected in a planning spreadsheet and used
to generate the final package based on those module versions. Each module MUST
be tagged in the module's source code repository with the module version number
at the point when that version is finally ready to be published.</p>

<p>This use of independent version numbers for the modules permits bug-fix
releases of individual modules to be made independently of other modules without
having to follow the full packaging release process in all of them.</p>

<p>The group may also publish non-core modules such as example programs. These
modules do not have to coordinated with the packaging of the core software, but
SHOULD be released using module version numbers that follow the numbering format
and policies described herein.</p>

<h3>Package version numbers</h3>

<p>The version number for the EPICS V4 software packages MUST take one of the
following forms:</p>

<pre>
4.<i>major</i>.<i>minor</i>
4.<i>major</i>.<i>minor</i>-<i>suffix</i>
4.<i>major</i>.<i>minor</i>.<i>bugfix</i>
4.<i>major</i>.<i>minor</i>.<i>bugfix</i>-<i>suffix</i>
</pre>

<ul>
  <li>The first component will always be <code>4</code>.</li>

  <li>The second component <code><i>major</i></code> increments at every major
    package release.</li>

  <li>The third component <code><i>minor</i></code> increments at every minor
    release, and is reset to zero whenever the <code><i>major</i></code>
    component changes.</li>

  <li>The fourth component <code><i>bugfix</i></code> increments at every
    bug-fix release, and is reset to zero whenever the <code><i>minor</i></code>
    component changes. This component and its preceding dot do not normally
    appear in the full version number when the component's value is zero.</li>

  <!-- &#x2011; is a non-breaking hyphen; not needed inside a <pre> block -->

  <li>The <code>&#x2011;<i>suffix</i></code> component and its preceding hyphen
    are only present in pre-release and release candidate version numbers, never
    in a final package release version number.<br />

    The <code>&#x2011;<i>suffix</i></code> component is used for development
    releases prior to a final package release version, and is normally either
    <code>&#x2011;pre<i>n</i></code> (a numbered pre-release) or
    <code>&#x2011;rc<i>n</i></code> (a numbered release-candidate).</li>
</ul>

<p>When printing or discussing a particular version number, the components
<code>4.<i>major</i>.<i>minor</i></code> SHOULD always be included. The
<code>.<i>bugfix</i></code> and/or <code>&#x2011;<i>suffix</i></code> parts are
optional, but SHOULD be included if they they are needed to identify the
specific version of the software concerned.</p>

<p>The suffix <code>&#x2011;BETA</code> that was included with some previous
release version numbers is confusing and MUST NOT be used in the future.</p>

<h3>Module version numbers</h3>

<p>Module version numbers and the related tags created in the module source code
repositories MUST take one of these forms:</p>

<pre>
<i>major</i>.<i>minor</i>.<i>bugfix</i>
<i>major</i>.<i>minor</i>.<i>bugfix</i>-<i>suffix</i>
</pre>

<ul>
<li>The leading <code>4.</code> component from the package version number MUST
NOT be included in the module version numbers or in the tags created in module
source code repositories.</li>

<li>The <code><i>major</i></code>, <code><i>minor</i></code> and
<code><i>bugfix</i></code> component meanings are as described for the package
version number above.</li>

<li>Unlike with the package version number, the <code>.<i>bugfix</i></code>
component MUST always be included, even when the number is zero.</li>

<li>Increments of the different components SHOULD occur to indicate
compatibility with previous release versions as described below.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tags MUST be created in one of the above formats to mark the releases of each
module. Module developers MAY use the pre-release and release-candidate suffixes
if desired, or may use the <code>.<i>bugfix</i></code> component to indicate
subsequent module releases when working towards a package release. The final
module version number of any module used in an official packaged release MUST
not contain a <code>&#x2011;<i>suffix</i></code> part.</p>


<h2>Release Compatibility</h2>

<p>There are two kinds of software compatibility, at the source-code level
(API) and the binary level (ABI). EPICS V4 releases will provide the following
compatibility promises across release boundaries:</p>

<h3>Major releases</h3>

<p>Neither ABI nor API compatibility is promised through a major release.</p>

<p>Developers SHOULD list and describe all public API changes that have occurred
since the last major release in the Release Notes for the module, and MUST
provide full documentation for the new API (usually using Doxygen or JavaDoc).
If an API change requires significant changes to code that calls that API, an
example showing both before and after code SHOULD be provided in or linked from
the Release Notes. Code using the older API SHOULD NOT successfully compile
against the new API if it will not run properly without modification.</p>

<p>Any incompatible change to the pvAccess network protocol MUST result in a
major release of the software at its next release.</p>

<h3>Minor releases</h3>

<p>Forward API compatibility is promised through a minor release but not ABI
compatibility, meaning that software written against the old version MUST be
able to compile and run against the new one without changing its source code;
recompilation of the software using the API is required against the new version
though. Backwards API compatibility is not promised, but where there have not
been any API changes an application written for a newer release SHOULD compile
and run successfully against an earlier minor release version.</p>

<p>Developers MUST consider these compatibility requirements during minor
release development. Tests SHOULD be written to check forward API compatibility
for all modules where public API changes are being made, ensuring that older
methods and routines remain fully functional in the modified implementation.</p>

<h3>Bug-fix releases</h3>

<p>Other than changes required by the bug fix, both forward and backward
compatibility MUST be provided for both the API and ABI through a bugfix
release. For architectures that use shared libraries, it should only be
necessary to replace the original shared libraries with the new ones, without
recompiling any application that uses them. For architectures that statically
link libraries into binary executables the link step will have to be re-run,
although in this case it may be better to just rebuild the application
completely.</p>

<p>Developers MUST consider these compatibility requirements while fixing bugs,
and MUST NOT make any modifications to the names, call signatures or semantics
of public API routines or methods unless those changes are needed to bring the
implementation into line with the originally-published specification. If a bug
cannot be fixed without making such a change, this policy requires that a minor
release be made instead of a bug-fix release.</p>

<p class="caption">Note: EPICS V4 developers do not have much experience of
promising ABI compatibility. This policy may change after reviewing this
experience for a time.</p>


<h2>Release Process</h2>

<p>This section describes the process by which new versions of the EPICS V4
software packages will be created, tested and published to the wider EPICS
community.</p>

<h3>Roles and responsibilities</h3>

<p>The following roles are used in the release process described below.
Individuals may take multiple roles as necessary.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Release Coordinator &ndash; a project manager for the release</li>
  <li>Module Owner &ndash; the lead developer for a module</li>
  <li>Module Developers &ndash; everyone who works on the code</li>
  <li>Module Packagers &ndash; the individuals who make tar/jar files</li>
  <li>Integration Testers &ndash; for release quality assurance</li>
  <li>Website Editor &ndash; the publicist and website manager</li>
</ul>

<h3>Release stages</h3>

<p>Different processes are appropriate for different kinds of releases. The
working group may override these requirements for specific releases, but the
stages below document the standard release process.</p>

<ul>

  <li>Major releases MUST go through all the stages described below.</li>

  <li>Minor releases MAY omit the pre-release stages if the developers are
  confident that their changes will not introduce new bugs.</li>

  <li>Bug-fix releases cannot by definition add any new features to the software
  and are intended to be released quickly, so they MAY go straight from the
  release decisision stage to issuing a release candidate, but this MUST be
  followed by at least a 1 week testing period before packaging and publishing
  the final release.</li>

</ul>


<h4>Release decision</h4>

<p>The working group or a designated Module Owner decides that a new version of
the software is to be released, determines what changes it should contain, and
whether this is to be a major, minor or bug-fix release. The release version
number is agreed, and a Release Coordinator is nominated to manage the release
process. Where the software to be released has a single Module Owner they would
normally be expected to take on the role of the Release Coordinator. The dates
for feature freeze and/or the final release may be discussed, but the process of
finding and fixing bugs can easily thwart a specific final release deadline so
such dates cannot be regarded as fixed at this stage.</p>

<h4>Release planning</h4>

<p>In the period between the release decision and feature freeze, the Release
Coordinator should consider the process described in this document and propose
any changes desired to the Working Group for agreement. In conjunction with the
Module Developers responsible for the software, the Release Coordinator should
develop and publish to the working group a preliminary timetable for the
remaining stages of the release process.</p>

<p>Module Developers should look for any remaining bugs that must/can be
fixed in this release, and provide feedback to the Release Coordinator about
the release timetable.</p>

<p>The Module Packagers should examine the release scripts and make any changes
to them that are required due to either changes in the release process or in the
software. This includes adding any new modules, removing any old ones that are
no longer to be included, and adjusting any dependency information to match.</p>

<h4>Features frozen</h4>

<p>Feature freeze is announced for some specific time and date and is thus an
instantaneous event, not a period of time. After that point, the software can be
said to have been frozen.</p>

<p>All development work on new features for a release must have been completed
by the freeze date; incomplete features should have been backed out and no
additional feature branches should be merged afterwards. Only bug fixes and
documentation updates should normally be committed between the freeze point and
the final release.</p>

<p>If circumstances require it, the working group may agree to unfreeze a
release in order to incorporate some additional features into the software. A
new freeze date should be agreed at the same meeting and the release timetable
for subsequent stages adjusted as appropriate.</p>

<p>After the freeze there will be a delay (normally 2 weeks but this may vary)
before the first pre-release is made. Module Developers are expected to spend
this period writing Release Notes, completing the documentation and testing
their software to identify and fix any major bugs before the software is
published to a wider audience. Module Packagers can use this time for testing
and refining their release scripts.</p>

<h4>Packaging</h4>

<p>The pre-release and release candidate stages described below represent the
period after those specific versions of the packages have been created and
published. The act of creating those packages is not instantaneous, past
experience has shown that coordinating the final commits and tagging of the
various core modules takes some time to do. In most cases individual modules
depend on other modules in what can be considered a stream; downstream modules
depend on upstream modules, but never the reverse. EPICS Base is considered to
be the ultimate source of the stream that all the EPICS V4 core modules depend
on.</p>

<p>Because of their inter-dependencies, upstream modules must be completed and
tagged before any modules downstream of them can be completed. In order to
streamline the packaging process, separate completion dates may be planned for
the different modules for each stage, either individually or by grouping related
modules together.</p>

<h4>Pre-releases</h4>

<p>These are tagged, built and/or packaged versions of the code, created by the
Module Packager(s) that are published as such for testing by the wider EPICS
developer community. The first pre-release of a new package release should have
a version number with the suffix <code>&#x2011;pre1</code> with any subsequent
pre-releases numbering the suffix sequentially. Each pre-release version is
normally left open for 2 weeks after publication, and any significant bugs
discovered in this period may result in one or more additional pre-release
versions being created after the bugs have been fixed.</p>

<p>Integration Testers should attempt to build and use the packaged software in
specific environments according to its documentation, and provide feedback and
bug-reports based on this experience.</p>

<p>Module Developers should continue to run tests on the software in unusual
configurations and on less common platforms during this period, and should also
read through and fix errors and omissions in the documentation.</p>

<h4>Release candidates</h4>

<p>Once the group believes the software to be free of major bugs and fully
documented, the Release Coordinator nominates the next packaged version to be a
release candidate. The first of these should be given the suffix
<code>&#x2011;rc1</code> with any subsequent versions numbering the suffix
sequentially. All release candidate versions should be publicized to the wider
EPICS user community for testing, and will normally be left open for 2
weeks.</p>

<p>If significant bugs are discovered they must be fixed, and the Module
Developers and Release Coordinator may then agree to publish another release
candidate version with those fixes, or may revert to a pre-release version to
ensure that any major bugs have been properly fixed.</p>

<h4>Final release</h4>

<p>Some time (usually 2 weeks) after a release candidate has been published with
no major bug reports given for it in that period, the final release package
should be created and published. Any remaining minor bugs that the group knows
about but has decided not to fix should be documented in the list of Known
Problems that accompanies the package release. The final release should be
announced to the EPICS user community, accompanied by a set of Release Notes
describing the major enhancements and changes that have been included.</p>
